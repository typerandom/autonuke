## Why

- Enforce a habit of never relying on hardware.
- Enforce a habit of always having the workstation setup scripted.
- Enforce that the latest software is up to date and that nothing that was unintentionally installed on the OS.

## Objectives

- It should be able to fully nuke and clean my macOS workstation.
- It should be able to schedule a nuke and visually show it when time is closing in.
